# filter() -> changes which rows are present without changing their order
# arrange() -> changes the order of the rows without changing which are present
# distinct() -> finds rows with unique values

# Filter verb

#All flights that departed on January 1

# COLUMNS

# Select verb
# columns by name

# EXERCISES

# 1) Compare dep_time, sched_dep_time, and dep_delay. How would you expect those three numbers to be related?

flights |>
  relocate(dep_time, sched_dep_time, dep_delay)

# The relation between these 3 numbers is: dep_time = sched_dep_time + dep_delay

# 2) Brainstorm as many ways as possible to select dep_time, dep_delay, arr_time, and arr_delay from flights.

# 3) What happens if you specify the name of the same variable multiple times in a select() call?

flights |> 
  select(arr_time, arr_time, arr_time)
# It will only be shown once

# 4) What does the any_of() function do? Why might it be helpful in conjunction with this vector?
variables <- c("year", "month", "day", "dep_delay", "arr_delay")
flights |>
  select(any_of(variables))

# 5) How do the select helpers deal with upper- and lowercase by default? How can you change that default?
flights |>
  select(contains("TIME"))
# The helper contains() ignore upper and lowercases.
# To change this default we can:

flights |>
  select(contains("TIME", ignore.case = FALSE))
